/*  Word Ladder
 *  Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:
 * 
 *  Only one letter can be changed at a time
 *  Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary
 *  For example,
 * 
 *  Given:
 *  start = "hit"
 *  end = "cog"
 *  dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
 *  As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
 *  return 
 *  [
 *    ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
 *    ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
 *  ]
 * 
 *  Note:
 *  All words have the same length.
 *  All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
